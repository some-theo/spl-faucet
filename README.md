# faucet

This project was created by Seahorse 0.2.7.

To get started, just add your code to **programs_py/faucet.py** and run `seahorse build`.

This is a program for a faucet that airdrops SPL-Tokens on the [Solana](https://solana.com) blockchain.

## Contributing

I am open to contributions. Please open an issue or pull request. Also it would be cool to have a better looking frontend than the one right now.
